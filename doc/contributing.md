Honestly, right now it's a free-for-all. Try not to break anyone else's stuff,
but be aware that Ed might mess around with yours while he's deciding on APIs,
coding standards and the like. He apologises unashamedly for this, and will try
to make sure he updates your code in line with any new policies being
implemented.

For now, just try to make sure you pull before you push, and add a useful tag.

## Example

```{bash}
$ git clone this.repo@github.com

<Make some changes>

$ git add <changes>
$ git commit '[USEFUL TAG] Adds a useful commit message'
$ git pull
$ git push
```

Watch this space!
